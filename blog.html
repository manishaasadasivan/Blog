        <p id="blog">Hyundai Motor America and Amazon Ads are again enhancing the car shopping experience with brand new features launched on Hyundai’s Evolve showroom on Amazon. The expansion of the digital showroom allows shoppers to discover available vehicles at participating dealers and begin the vehicle selection process directly on Amazon. Customers can configure and estimate the price of their desired Hyundai vehicle, locate real-time inventory and contact dealers to complete the sale. The Hyundai Evolve showroom can be found at Amazon.com/Hyundai.
            “Our mission is to be the leader in a seamless, digital and transparent retail experience in partnership with our dealer body,” said José Muñoz, president and CEO, Hyundai Motor North America. “The events of the last 18 months have made it clear that many consumers want a car buying process that aligns with how they purchase nearly everything else in their life. Amazon is a leading retailer and we’re excited to continue collaborating with them on digital retail experiences.”

Alan Moss, VP of Global Ad Sales for Amazon Ads, said: “We are thrilled Hyundai is continuing to innovate with us to evolve their showroom experience. We look forward to deeper collaboration on new features that enhance the showroom and make it even more helpful for customers as they discover and research Hyundai vehicles.”
